# APLN553 : Text Anlysis Project 

## Topic : **MEDI Script**

Transforming unstructured clinical notes into actionable Using Unix/Linux Command-Line Script

## Backgroud:
- Important information reported by patients is often ignored unless the doctor has enough time to thoroughly review it, which typically requires more than two visits. 
In most cases, these notes are frequently written by different practitioners, and electronic health records (EHR) systems lack the ability to summarize or flag key issues effectively.
- My project aims to extract this critical information, enabling faster and more accurate prognoses and diagnoses, surpassing the efficiency of manual review by humans

## Reserch Questions
- Can text preprocessing tools help us derive meaningful insights from clinical notes?
- Given clinical discharge notes, can we determine the prevalence of adverse drug events (ADEs)?
- Which patient demographics (age, gender) are most frequently associated with specific ADEs?
- Which medications are most commonly linked to ADEs, and what types of ADEs are associated with each medication?

## Conclusion
- While we are able to Extract some insights using only Linux Utilities, they are only ahs good for basic text preprocessing. 
The recognition of negation modifiers represents an important challenge.

## Moving Forward

-I hope to leverage advanced NLP techniques with dense representations (embeddings) and incorporating attention mechanisms solve negation recognition
